# This script renames Proteus ARES output ZIP files so they are suitable
# for easy upload to the OSHPark PCB service.
#
# Output gerber data from ARES like normal then run this script and choose
# the *CADCAM.ZIP file.  A new ZIP file will be created - the original is
# not modified in any way.
#
# Use layer Mech 1 for the board outline because no dedicated outline
# file is produced.  Mech 1 should be empty but the outline is placed
# on all layers, so it will appear here.
#
# If you wish to use internal cutouts or slots then draw these on the 
# Mech 1 layer as described in the tutorial: http://tinyurl.com/o2w8v83
# This will ensure they end up on the dimension layer.
#
# Files that are not needed (e.g. the README) are not copied to the new
# ZIP.  Extra files in the output ZIP will cause OSHPark validation to fail.
#
# Note that OSHPark seems to require all files to be present - even if
# there is nothing on the layer.  Therefore you should export all files
# from ARES (don't untick the checkboxes).
